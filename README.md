# TelegramCalendarBot

A calendar bot for Telegram.

You can:
- add events
- remove events by date, description or both
- list events for the following day, week, month, or all upcoming

Events are saved in an SQLite database. Can be used by multiple users simultaneously,
since it creates a unique table for every user by their Telegram ID.

Note: mainly works as a practice, not very practical...
unless you want to boycott the default calendar app for some reason.
